Launching SourceTree in the Labs
================================

SourceTree and Git refuse to play nicely with the network drive in the labs, so there is some setup that will need to be done every time you log in and want to use SourceTree. It's actually pretty difficult to do incorrectly. Once you've done it a few times, you probably won't need this guide anymore.

*Launch SourceTree, and wait a little bit...*

**Dialog Box - SourceTree: Git not found**

Click "Download an embedded version of Git for SourceTree alone to use."
Watch the progress bar.

**Dialog Box - SourceTree: Mercurial not found**

Click "I don't want to use Mercurial"

**Dialog Box - Welcome**

Type either your Full Name, or your GitHub username. (whichever you prefer)
Type the email address associated with your GitHub account.
Check the box for I agree to the SourceTree license agreement

Click Next

**Dialog Box - Welcome (SSH Client Configuration)**

Use PuTTY / Plink (recommended) is fine

Click Next

**Dialog Box - Load SSH Key?**

Click No

**Dialog Box - Welcome**

Click Finish

The main SourceTree window will open.
Wait a few seconds...
*(hahaha you thought you were done?)*

**Dialog Box - Found Updates for SourceTree**

Click Download and install now

The box next to the most recent update should be checked by default.
Click Next.

**Dialog Box - SourceTree Setup**

(Welcome screen) Click Next.
(Installation folder) Click Next.
Click Install.

The radio button next to "Automatically close applications and attempt to restart them after setup is complete" should be selected.
Click OK.

Watch more progress bars.

The checkbox next to Launch SourceTree should be checked by default.
Click Finish.

Now we're finally ready to use SourceTree.
